.SH NAME
bro-cut \- parse Bro logs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bro\-cut
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIcolumns\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Extracts the given columns from ASCII Bro logs on standard input, and outputs
them to standard output.  If no columns are given, all are selected. By
default,
.B bro\-cut
does not include format header blocks in the output.
.PP
Columns are specified as a list of space-separated field names.  The order of
field names given to \fBbro-cut\fR determines the output order,
which means \fBbro-cut\fR can be used to reorder columns.
.PP
The ASCII Bro logs read on standard input must have intact format header
blocks because \fBbro-cut\fR needs this information to correctly interpret the
log file format.  In fact, \fBbro-cut\fR can process the concatenation of
multiple ASCII log files that have different column layouts.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Include the first format header block into the output.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR
Include all format header blocks into the output.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Convert time values into human\-readable format.
.HP
\fB\-D\fR <fmt> Like \fB\-d\fR, but specify format for time (see strftime(3) for syntax).
.HP
\fB\-F\fR <ofs> Sets a different output field separator.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Print all fields except those specified.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
Like \fB\-d\fR, but print timestamps in UTC instead of local time.
.HP
\fB\-U\fR <fmt> Like \fB\-D\fR, but print timestamps in UTC instead of local time.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B BRO_CUT_TIMEFMT
For time conversion option \fB\-d\fR or \fB\-u\fR, the format string can be
specified by setting this environment variable.
.SH EXAMPLES
Output three columns and convert time values:
.br
cat conn.log | bro-cut -d ts id.orig_h id.orig_p
.PP
Output all columns and convert time values with a custom format string:
.br
cat conn.log | bro-cut -D "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
